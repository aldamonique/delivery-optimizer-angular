# Vehicle Routing Problem Solver with Genetic Algorithm  

Final project for the Artificial Intelligence course at Instituto Federal da Bahia (IFBA)

This project features a full-stack solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), including a Python FastAPI backend that implements a Genetic Algorithm and a responsive Angular dashboard for visualization and interaction.

The API is designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems by considering vehicle capacities, costs, and client time windows, while the dashboard provides an intuitive user interface to generate new problems and view the optimized solutions.
